# Spam-Classification-using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks
Developed an NLP-based spam classification system using RNN models to automatically detect spam messages. Implemented data preprocessing, tokenization, and model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score. Demonstrated end-to-end machine learning pipeline development with real-world text data.

## 🚀 Overview
This project focuses on developing an intelligent spam detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to automatically classify text messages as spam or legitimate. It involves data preprocessing, text feature extraction, and training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to learn sequential patterns in textual data and improve message filtering accuracy. 
This project aims to automatically identify spam messages by applying machine learning and NLP techniques, including text preprocessing, feature extraction, and sequence modeling to accurately classify messages as spam or legitimate.
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can automatically classifies messages as spam or legitimate by learning sequential text patterns and implementing a complete machine learning pipeline from preprocessing to model evaluation.
